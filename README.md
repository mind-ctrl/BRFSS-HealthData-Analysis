# BRFSS-HealthData-Analysis
Analyszed the BRFSS dataset to find out how alcohol consumptions affects Ashtma and Sleep cycle in VETERANS

The dataset can be downloaded here: https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2014.html

Steps involved were:

1. Design phase:
- Understanding the BRFSS dataset
- How was the data collected? When and from who
- Understanding the features and limitations of the dataset
- operationalized subpopulation, exposure, and outcome
- Choosing confounders

2. Developing the analytical dataset
- Read in the data
- Applied inclusions and exclusions
- Generated exposure and outcome variables

3. Descriptive analyses and developing Table 1s
- Applied inclusions and exclusions
- Documented exclusions 

4. Conducting Descriptive Analysis
- Prepared Table 1s for the categorical outcome (Asthma) and continuous outcome (Sleep Duration)
- Added overall frequencies to both Table 1s
- Included results of the stratified analysis

5. Bivariate Tests
- Chi-Squared and Fisher's exact test for categorical
- ANOVA and t_test for continuous
- Added these to Table 1s

6. Next Steps 
- Adding regression analysis
